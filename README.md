# ML-Implementations

Implementing some basic ML algorithms, one at a time!

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms. The goal is to provide simple and clear code examples for educational purposes. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch to aid understanding of the underlying principles.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r2d2butbetter/ML-Implementations.git
cd ML-Implementations
```

Ensure you have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the required packages using:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Algorithms Implemented
* Linear Regression
* More coming soon
